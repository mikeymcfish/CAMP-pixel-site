						<div class="question">
							Can I stay with my child at CAMP/pixel?
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							We do ask our parents to leave once the check-in process is complete. The first few hours of each camp are largely about assimilation; we make every effort to inspore a sense of comfort and excitement in each of our campers. We have every parent's contact information on hand and we don't hesitate to call.

					<div class="FAQQuestion" data-keywords="game,games,free,time,minecraft,mine,craft">
						<div class="question">
							How do I know my child is not just playing video games all day? 
						</div>
						<div class="answer">
							At CAMP/pixel, "free time" is earned and not abused. Campers may be found testing a game or mod they design or taking a few minutes for a well-earned fun break, but they all know from day 1 that it's not what CAMP/pixel is all about.

If you're undecided as to which to reserve for your child, we recommend you show them the topics and ask them which looks best!
