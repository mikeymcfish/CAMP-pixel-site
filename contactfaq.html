						<div class="answer">
							At CAMP/pixel, "free time" is earned and not abused. Campers may be found testing a game or mod they design or taking a few minutes for a well-earned fun break, but they all know that it's not what CAMP/pixel is all about.

					<div class="FAQQuestion" data-keywords="stay,parent,adult,hang,learn">
