						Every day at CAMP/pixel is packed from morning to afternoon with invigorating, inspiring activities both on and off the screen. Campers are surrounded by endless resources, whether it be technology, physical activity, or tools for a fun challenge. We've created and time-tested a perfect blend of focus and just goofing around to build a social, motivating experience in which imaginative young minds can thrive. For a part of each day, they'll be honed in on their with our expert instructors. For another, they'll be bonding with each other at the playground. They're with Pixel Academy staff throughout the day to ensure that they're always excited, engaged, and standing by our Rule #1: Have Fun.

							DIGITAL PROJECT
						</div>
						<div class="detailText">
							The first half of our meticulously-planned Combos this summer is the Digital Project. The Telegraph says that "using technology in an educational environment not only better reflects children's life outside the classroom, but also allows them to hone their digital skills in a way that will continue to be valuable throughout their adult life." Whether it's coding or modding a video game, digital animation, or music production, this is the camper's opportunity to imagine and create a digital project. Using industry-grade technology, campers will embark on a 1- or 2-week journeys with our instructors to understand and develop skills in new software, design a unique project, and leave with knowledge they'll see time and time again in and out of their education.

							PHYSICAL PROJECT
						</div>
						<div class="detailText">
							As Scholastic put so well, "hands-on, creative, and artistic activities help students to focus and retain knowledge, and at the same time emphasize the importance of beauty and design in our world." The Combo's complement to a week's Digital Project is the Physical Project; while each camper spends a good amount of time producing something digital, he or she will work to produce a physical product as well. Campers can work on laser cutting, 3D design, DJing, and much more. Each Physical Project will require some on-screen and off-screen work to accomplish its goal.
